\* constant definitions (modify this to change the model size)
CONSTANTS
   Proc = {p1, p2, p3, p4}
   Values = {v1}
   Byzantine = {p4}
   Initiator = p1
   MaxMsgCount = 10 \* only used in the constraint StateConstraint

\* safety properties
INVARIANTS
  TypeOK
  BRB_Validity
  BRB_Integrity
  BRB_NoDuplicity \* a.k.a. agreement

\* liveness properties
\* PROPERTIES
\*   BRB_Termination1 \* liveness version of validity
\*   BRB_Termination2 \* a.k.a. totality

\* state constraint to prevent infinite state space exploration due to the
\* Byzantine process's arbitrary message generation
CONSTRAINT
  StateConstraint

\* optimization for checking safety properties (doesn't work together with
\* liveness properties)
SYMMETRY
  Symmetry

CHECK_DEADLOCK
  FALSE
